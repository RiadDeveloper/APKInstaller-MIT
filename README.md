## Using the APK Installer Extension


1. **Call the APK Installer Function**
- In the blocks editor, use the "call APKInstaller" block and provide the file path of the APK you want to install. This could be a path on your device, such as "/sdcard/filename.apk".




## Permissions and File Path Important Notes

- **Permissions:**
  - Ensure that your Android device allows the installation of apps from unknown sources. You can adjust this setting in your device's security or privacy settings.
